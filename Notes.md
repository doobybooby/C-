# Notes

## Exception handling
* Exception is used catch errors on code early. 
* Keep all the variable in the local scope.
```c++
try
{
}
catch
{
}
```
## Inherihance
* Polymorphism

###### Abstract Data Type
* Type defined in terms of its data items and assoicated operations, not its implementation

> Class.method() //You can create an object of the class and use any related method. You don't know the full implementation of the method

###### Encapsulation 
* Hides, the values or state of a structured data obejct, inside a class
* Public accessible methods are getters and setters
