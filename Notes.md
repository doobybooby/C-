# Notes

## Exception handling
* Exception is used catch errors on code early. 
* Keep all the variable in the local scope.
```c++
try
{
}
catch
{
}
```
# Inherihance
* Polymorphism

## Abstract Data Type
* Type defined in terms of its data items and assoicated operations, not its implementation

> Class.method() //You can create an object of the class and use any related method. You don't know the full implementation of the method

## Encapsulation 
* Hides, the values or state of a structured data obejct, inside a class
* Public accessible methods are getters and setters

# Containers
* anything that hold something, and you can access it. Such as array, vector, map, list 
* Simple: Containers that store individual objects
 > Circular Array for temperature readings
* Associative:: Containes that store keys but also store records associated with those keys
 > Student ID for Student Academic Record
 
 ###### Memory allocation
 * Contiguous, array
 * linked, linked list
 * indexed
